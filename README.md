# GWAS_Analysis_for_PRS
GWAS Pre-processing and QC Pipeline

This repository contains R scripts and documentation for the pre-processing and quality control (QC) pipeline used in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). 

The aim is to ensure high-quality genotype data suitable for downstream association analysis.

The pipeline follows community standards and best practices, including sample and SNP-level filtering, relatedness checks, population structure inference, and data preparation for PRS computation.
